Apollo
=====

"Fork Apollo" to create a new MOOSE-based application.

For more information see: [http://mooseframework.org/create-an-app/](http://mooseframework.org/create-an-app/)

Currently requires custom LibMesh installation to enable use of NEDELEC_ONE elements on TET10 meshes and curl operations on LAGRANGE_VEC FEs.
